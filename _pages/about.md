I am a research scientist in the Ads Ranking & Foundational AI team at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), where I leverage machine learning to tackle critical business challenges. My primary focus has been on Recommendation Systems, exploring various topics within this domain.

Prior to joining Meta, I earned my Ph.D. from [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [C. Lee Giles](http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) and received my bachelor's degree in computer science from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).
